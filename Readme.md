### Development setup ðŸ› 

Steps to locally setup development after cloning the project.

`docker-compose up -d --build`
or simple
`make build` ;)

Make sure you rename .env.example to .env and declare the environment variables in root folder for docker to pickup!

### Browsable API

The application features a full featured browsable api for quick verification.
Once you have the local server running simply head on to

http://localhost:8000/api/v1/

## Sample Requests

```
### Import League
POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/import-league/AU/


### Players filtered by league
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/players/PL/


### Players filtered by league is case insensitive
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/players/pl/


### Players filtered by INVALID league - throws http 404
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/players/PLA/


### Players filtered by league and team
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/players/PL/BOU/


### Players filtered by valid league and invalid team - throws http 404
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/players/PL/BOA/

### If you request for players by valid league and valid team but
### team is not part of the league then you'd get an empty response


### Teams Detail view
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/teams/ARS/


### Teams Detail view is case insensitive
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/teams/ars/


### Teams Detail view show players as well
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/teams/ARS/?players=true

### You can alos access a team with all its players like this
GET http://localhost:8000/api/v1/teams/ARS/players/

```

### Admin Interface

For convenience we have access to an admin interface provided by django.

All data models are hooked up to the admin interface to verify if data has been correctly
populated in the database.

But to access the admin you would need to create a super user by running the following

```
make superuser
```

Provide a username, password, email and then you can access admin at http://localhost:8000/admin/

The interface should look like this
